    <h1>Document Object Model</h1>
    <p>
        What is a <strong>DOM</strong>: Its full name is Document Object Model aka . It is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style content.<a href="http://https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dom-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-document-object-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em> The Remote </em></a>

        <em>Imagine this</em>: you have the TV on. You don't like the show that's being streamed, and you want to change it. You also want to increase its volume.To do that, there has to be a way for you to interact with your television. And what do you use to do that?
    </p>
    <p>
        It does this by communicating with the browser using the properties, methods, and events in the interface called the Document Object Model, or DOM. For example, say that you want a button to change colours when it gets clicked or an image to slide when the mouse hovers over it. First, you need to reference those elements from your JavaScript.The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser. It represents the web page using a‌‌ series of objects. The main object is the document object, which in turn houses other objects which also house their own objects, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        And in the same way, JavaScript makes the HTML page active and dynamic via the DOM.Just like how the television can't do much for itself, JavaScript doesn't do much more than allow you to‌‌ perform some calculations or work with basic strings.So to make an HTML document more interactive and dynamic, the script‌‌ needs to be able to access the contents of the document and it also needs to know when the user is interacting with it.
